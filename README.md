## üóíÔ∏è Notes

- This is a **frontend-only prototype** ‚Äî there is no backend or database integration.
- The glasses overlay is approximately aligned for demonstration purposes; it may not be perfectly accurate in all cases.
- All assets, including eyeglass images and face detection models, are served directly from the `public/` folder.
