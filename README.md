##  Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DuaeZahra/eyeglasses-tryon.git
cd eyeglasses-tryon
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## üß† How It Works

1. **Face Detection**  
   MediaPipe FaceMesh detects **468 facial landmarks** (eyes, nose bridge, temples).

2. **3D Glasses Placement**  
   The glasses model is **cloned, positioned, scaled, and rotated** based on the detected facial landmark geometry.

3. **Rendering**  
   Three.js overlays the 3D model on top of the video or uploaded image feed in real-time.

## üóíÔ∏è Notes

- This is a **frontend-only prototype** ‚Äî there is no backend or database integration.
- The glasses overlay is approximately aligned for demonstration purposes; it may not be perfectly accurate in all cases.
- All assets, including eyeglass images and face detection models, are served directly from the `public/` folder.
